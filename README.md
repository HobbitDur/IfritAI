# How to use
First, you need to get monster files. They are accessible by using [Deling tool](https://github.com/myst6re/deling). Extract from the battle.fs the c0mxxx.dat files. Files containing monster start from c0m001.dat up to c0m143.dat with c0m123.dat being a garbage file.
Then you can open this file using the directory button of the tool.
Most button have tooltip, don't hesitate to hover them.
A wiki will be worked on soon. Check the advancement on the [Github wiki](https://github.com/HobbitDur/IfritAI/wiki).
